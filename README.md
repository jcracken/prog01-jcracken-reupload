### SDL Demo code

Author: Joshua Levine

This code provides an introductory demonstration of SDL as well as basic build scripts with CMake.


### Sample README

All project submissions should include a README file.  READMEs provides a text description of how to run your program and any command line parameters that you used.  Also document any idiosyncracies, behaviors, or bugs of note that you want us to be aware of.

Please edit this file accordingly.  Note that it is formatted in standard Markdown syntax.  Some examples for more info are the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and [Daring Fireball: Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

### Attributions

I modified the CMakeLists.txt file to reflect the CMakeLists.txt file used by ECE 275 and other ECE classes in order to get CMAke to work better.
